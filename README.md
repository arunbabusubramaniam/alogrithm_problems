# Alogrithm

1. [SelectionSort](https://github.com/arunbabusubramaniam/alogrithms/blob/master/SelectionSort/Java/SelectionSort.java)
      * Time Complexity - O(n^2)
      * Space Complexity - O(1)
      * In Place Algorithm
      * May be Stable or unstable (Based on the elements in the array)

2. [InsertionSort](https://github.com/arunbabusubramaniam/alogrithms/blob/master/InsertionSort/Java/InsertionSort.java)
      * Time complexity
          - Best Case - O(N)
          - Average Case - O(N^2)
          -	Worst Case - O(N^2)
      * In Place Algorithm
      * Stable Algorithm
      * Space Complexity - O(1)
